# Ping-pong-game
A simple ping pong game in Python using pygame for sound effects and turtle for graphics. Two players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth, aiming to prevent the ball from passing their paddle. The game updates scores when a player misses, and resets the ball to the center.

The game simulates a classic table tennis setup where two paddles are controlled by the players to bounce a ball back and forth.

Turtle is used to create the window, paddles, and ball.

Pygame can be used to add sound effects or graphical enhancements like scoring or background music.

The game starts with a ball in the center of the screen that moves in a diagonal direction.

Players control their paddles with the keyboard (e.g., 'W' and 'S' keys for Player 1, and the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys for Player 2).

The goal is to prevent the ball from going past your paddle and into your opponent's side.

When the ball reaches one end of the screen, the score is updated, and the ball resets to the center.
