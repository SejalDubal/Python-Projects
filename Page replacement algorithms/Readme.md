# Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

This project simulates various **Page Replacement Algorithms** used in operating systems to manage memory efficiently. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing how different algorithms handle page faults and replace pages in memory.

## Features
- **Supported Algorithms**:
  - FIFO (First In First Out)
  - LRU (Least Recently Used)
  - Optimal Page Replacement
  - MRU (Most Recently Used)
- **Visualization**: Real-time visualization of page frames, page faults, and hit/miss ratios.
- **Theory Section**: Learn about the working and theory behind each algorithm.
